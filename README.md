# Emotion Classification with Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning to classify text into six emotions: **anger**, **fear**, **joy**, **love**, **sadness**, and **surprise**. The model is designed to analyze customer feedback and other text data, providing insights to improve user engagement, customer service, and content personalization.

## Overview

The primary goal is to develop a text-based emotion detection model to help businesses understand user sentiment. Applications include customer support, marketing insights, and improved content recommendations.

### Key Features
- **Emotion Detection**: Classifies text into one of six emotions.
- **Model Deployment**: The model is deployed on Streamlit for interactive use.
- **Insights**: Offers business insights by identifying user sentiment and adjusting responses accordingly.
